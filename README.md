# Notion Task Manager

A Python CLI tool to quickly add tasks to a Notion database, with flexible input for dates, timezones, and recurring ‚Äúquick access‚Äù times.  

I'm using this script to manage assignments and deadlines in my Notion database through the CLI instead of the Notion UI (because it's overstimulating üòï).

## What It Does

- **Interactive prompts** for all task properties defined in your Notion database  
- **Flexible date input**: supports `YYYY-MM-DD`, `MM-DD`, and optional time.  
- **Quick-access times**: choose from pre-defined common times if no time is provided.  
- **Timezone support**: choose a timezone or use the default.  
- **Supports select, multi-select, status, people, and relation properties**.  
- **Summarizes the task** before submitting to Notion.
